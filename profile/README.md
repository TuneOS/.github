<h1 align="center">TuneOS</h1>
<h2 align="center">A `Fyne-ly Tuned` Operating-System.</h2>

<p align="center"><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> TuneOS is a non-officially sanctioned, highly-experimental 'cousin' of <a href="https://github.com/FyshOS">FyshOS</a>. 
If you're planning on trying to daily-drive a FyneDesk centered distro/OS, you should really be using FyshOS proper atm; Because currently, Tune has no promise of stability and may make massive changes that could break your system in any given update. </br>You've been warned! </p>

Okay, so ... if that didn't scare you off; lol.
